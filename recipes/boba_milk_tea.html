        <h3>Description</h3>
        
        <p>
            A lazy mashed potato recipe that is sure to make you want to go out and get something real to eat.
            Creamy to a level of mediocrity and as boring as its stagnant color.
            Warning: Don't eat if you are allergic to potatoes.
