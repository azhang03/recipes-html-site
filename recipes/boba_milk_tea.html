        <h3>Description</h3>
        
        <p>
            A somewhat violent boba milk tea recipe that is sure to make you never want to drink boba again.
            This recipe requires the cook to own or have access to a dwarf hamster or Great Horned Toad farm. 
            It will be the most ambiguous milk tea you've ever tasted.
